TODO
====

- Merge the three private "npm packages" together
- Refactor / simplify the micromark plugin, now it doesn't have to support compiling to HTML or parsing abbrCalls
- See if there's a nice way to remove the empty `<div>` tags output by remark-rehype, without needing the user to pass a custom handler
- Lots more tests
